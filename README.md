# Downloaded Files Manager

We will use the watchdog library in Python, which is a helpful tool for monitoring file system events, such as changes to files or directories. It allows you to automate tasks that respond to events like file creation, modification, or deletion.
In our case, we want to automate the process of downloaded files management, store each file type in a specific folder. (Images in downloaded images, documents i downloaded documents etc.)
